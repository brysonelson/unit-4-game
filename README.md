# Star Wars RPG Game

### Overview

To start the game, you can click on instructions (which will open and close when clicked again) or start game.

When you click start, two buttons appear up top. Instructions will alert you the same instructions you had on the homepage, so you can always refer back to them. Reset will reload the page back to the very beginning. You will also be given a choice of 4 characters each with randomly generated HP, AP, and CAP. 

You want to choose a character with a fair amount of HP, decent attack power, to win the fastest.

You then will choose an enemy. You should aim to choose an enemy with a low counter attack power, as you want to build up your attack power before battling the more powerful enemies.

Attack the enemy with the attack button until their HP is 0. They will die, and you will then need to pick your second opponent. 

Continue attacking and picking enemies until you have either lost (the game will alert you and then reload), or won (the game will play the winning sound and show you've won, and then reset after a few seconds).
